# FlexFlowExtension

## Note that the most significant changes can be found in src/runtime/model.cc and model.cu

FlexFlow is a deep learning framework that accelerates distributed DNN training by automatically searching for efficient parallelization strategies. FlexFlow provides a drop-in replacement for TensorFlow Keras and PyTorch. Running existing Keras and PyTorch programs in FlexFlow only requires [a few lines of changes to the program](https://flexflow.ai/keras).
